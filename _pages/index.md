# PhishGuard: Intelligent Voice Phishing Detection

PhishGuard is an intelligent solution designed to detect potential voice phishing attempts in real time by analyzing the content of ongoing calls. Unlike traditional spam call detectors, which primarily rely on call frequency or blacklists, PhishGuard sets itself apart by focusing on the actual conversation content, identifying specific words and phrases commonly used in phishing attempts.  
   
   

## Features

- **Real-Time Phishing Detection**: Analyzes the conversation in real-time to identify potential phishing attempts.
- **Content-Based Analysis**: Detects suspicious words and phrases typically used in voice phishing.
- **Immediate Alerts**: Provides instant feedback and alerts the user if a phishing attempt is detected during the call.  
   
   

## Why PhishGuard?

Voice phishing is an increasingly serious threat, with scammers impersonating trusted institutions to steal personal information. While traditional advice like "stay calm and composed" is often offered, it frequently fails in high-pressure situations. PhishGuard offers an intelligent alternative by evaluating the conversation's content in real-time, enabling users to make informed decisions during potentially dangerous calls.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                


## How It Works

1. **Call Content Analysis**: PhishGuard listens to the ongoing call and analyzes the text for common phishing indicators.
2. **Real-Time Detection**: The system compares the conversation content against known phishing patterns and phrases.
3. **Alert System**: If a phishing attempt is detected, PhishGuard immediately alerts the user, providing a warning.
